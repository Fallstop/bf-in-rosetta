# bf-in-ressota

Brainfuck interpreter in every language. Because yes.

## <b>TAKE YA PICK</b>

### Currently complete languages

- #### Rust
  [![rust-bf](https://snapcraft.io//rust-bf/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rust-bf)
  The fastest brainfuck interpreter of the lot, it's optimized beyond reason. It's so fast, it can easily overflow a 64bit number 200 times over in under a second with our example program. It's also available via snap.
- #### Python
- #### C++
- #### Scratch
- #### PHP
  Can be found [Here](http://brainfucked.qrl.nz) or [at Github](https://github.com/LaSpruca/brainfuck-php) as a part of another project.
- #### Java
- #### C#
- #### Go
- #### TypeScript
  Specifically made to be incompatible with Javascript
- #### R
  In case you want to plot the output for some reason.
- #### Flutter App
- #### Ruby
- #### [Brainfuck-Shell](https://github.com/Fallstop/brainfuck-shell)
  Fully functioning shell that parses the input as Brainfuck and runs the result.
- #### Haskell
- #### C
- #### Lisp (Common Lisp)
- #### OCaml
- #### Zig
- #### Asm

### In progress languages

### Languages that were abandoned for mental health reasons

- #### B
  Development stopped because we could not find a working compiler that both compiled and not get rid of random variables in the program (_Flashbacks intensify_).

## <b>THE EXAMPLE BF</b>

Custom code based on the superior decimal output flavor of BF.

dune exec bf -- ../helloWorld.bf
